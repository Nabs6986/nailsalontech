# Persona 3: The Salon Owner
**"I went from doing nails to running a business. It's a whole different job — and I need tools that match."**

---

## Overview

The Salon Owner is the most complex persona. She started as a nail tech (or esthetician/cosmetologist), built a client base, and eventually opened her own space. Now she manages 2–10 nail techs, juggles the schedule for multiple staff members, and is responsible for payroll, reporting, compliance, and growth. She still does some client work herself, but increasingly her time is split between the chair and managing the business. She needs software that scales — not just a solo booking tool, but a platform that handles her full operation.

She's typically past the "which tool is cheapest?" question. Now it's: *"Which tool actually works for a team, and won't drive my staff insane?"*

## Day in the Life

**8:00am** — Opens the salon. Checks the day's bookings for all 4 staff members. Two techs have gaps — she makes a mental note to discuss their rebooking rates.

**9:00am** — First client arrives (hers). She's on the floor doing a full set while simultaneously answering a staff question about a client rebooking.

**11:30am** — Receives an alert: client "no-showed" for one of her tech's 11am appointment. Checks if deposit was collected. It wasn't — tech forgot to require it for walk-in regulars. Frustrated.

**1:00pm** — Lunch. Tries to pull a weekly revenue report by staff member. Her current software makes it a 10-step process. Gives up, moves on.

**2:00pm** — Staff conflict. One tech complains another "took" her regular while she was on vacation. No client ownership tracking in the system.

**4:00pm** — Calls accountant about payroll. The software doesn't export cleanly to her accounting tool. More manual spreadsheet work.

**6:00pm** — Last client leaves. Locks up. Reviews today's receipts. Realizes she hasn't sent marketing emails in 3 weeks. Opens software → gets overwhelmed → closes it.

**8:00pm** — Googles: *"best salon software for multiple staff reporting 2024."* Starts a trial. Gets overwhelmed. Goes to bed.

## Pain Points (Ranked)

**#1 — Multi-Staff Scheduling & Visibility**
> *"I need to see all four of my girls' schedules at a glance. My current app makes me click through to each one."*
- Single-page calendar view for all staff is table stakes but often poorly executed
- Staff schedule conflicts are common: two techs booked at the same time on one chair
- Owner needs to manage PTO, call-outs, and coverage without chaos
- Needs: multi-column calendar view, staff permissions, scheduling across multiple providers
- GlossGenius flagged: *"I'm not able to view my staff appointments without clicking a view all button."* — App Store review

**#2 — Reporting & Business Visibility**
> *"I don't actually know which of my techs is making me money. I should know that."*
- Needs revenue by staff member, service type, time period
- Commission calculation should be automatic, not manual Excel work
- Wants retention rate by client and staff: who's losing their regulars?
- Tip and service split reporting for payroll
- GlossGenius noted: *"Their reports suck"* (r/Esthetics) for multi-staff scenarios
- Vagaro and Mangomint are stronger here; key differentiator in this segment

**#3 — Staff Management & Accountability**
> *"Managing staff is extremely difficult. They fight, call out sick, and sometimes steal clients."*
- Staff no-shows to their shifts disrupt the entire day's schedule
- Client poaching (staff taking regulars when they leave) is a real fear
- Staff permissions: owner doesn't want all staff to see revenue reports
- Needs: tiered permissions, client ownership tracking, staff notes

**#4 — Payroll & Commission Complexity**
> *"I have two commission employees, one booth renter, and one hourly front desk. My payroll is a nightmare."*
- Different pay structures for different staff types (commission %, flat fee, hourly)
- Tips must be tracked and distributed properly
- Payroll integration with Gusto/ADP/QuickBooks is critical
- Tax compliance risk: misclassifying booth renters as employees = audits
- Needs: payroll reporting, multi-structure support, clean export

**#5 — Marketing & Client Retention at Scale**
> *"I'm too busy putting out fires to think about marketing. But I know I'm losing clients."*
- No time to manually send retention campaigns
- Needs automated "we miss you" emails/texts (6-week lapse trigger)
- Online booking for multiple staff members with correct service routing
- Reputation management: auto-request Google reviews post-appointment

## Goals

| Goal | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Profitability clarity** | Know exactly which services/staff are profitable; cut/add accordingly |
| **Less admin, more done** | Payroll, scheduling, reporting should run without her |
| **Staff accountability** | Track performance; know who's retaining clients, who's not |
| **Client retention** | Reduce client churn with automated follow-ups |
| **Growth** | Open second location OR increase per-location revenue 20–30% |
| **Work ON the business** | Spend 50% time managing vs. doing nails (not 100% on the floor) |
| **Less turnover chaos** | When a tech leaves, retain clients in the salon (not follow them out) |

---

## Decision Factors (Ranked)

1. **Multi-Staff Functionality** — Can it handle her whole team cleanly?
2. **Reporting Quality** — Revenue by staff, commission tracking, retention data
3. **Payroll/Commission Handling** — Multiple pay structures supported?
4. **Reliability & Uptime** — Can't have software down on a Saturday
5. **Ease of Staff Training** — Will her team actually adopt it without a revolt?
6. **Price at Scale** — Per-user pricing adds up; how much does it cost for 5 staff?
7. **Customer Support** — When something breaks at 9am Friday, is someone reachable?
8. **Marketing Automation** — Email/SMS re-engagement without manual work

## Objections

| Objection | Reality / Reframe |
|-----------|------------------|
| *"Switching software when you have a team is too risky"* | True risk — migration plan and support matter; pitch: "we'll help you migrate" |
| *"My staff is used to the current system"* | If the system causes daily friction, staff will welcome something better |
| *"It's too expensive for 5–6 staff members"* | $10/user/month × 6 = $60–80 more than solo tools; frame as cost per staff hour saved |
| *"I've tried 3 systems and they all disappoint me"* | This is common and real — she's jaded; proof matters more than features |
| *"I don't have time to evaluate and switch software"* | She'll find time when the pain is bad enough; timing is everything |
| *"The reporting is probably too basic"* | Show specific screenshots/demos of commission and retention reports |

---

## Language & Tone

She's a business owner, not just a nail tech. She speaks both languages fluently — the craft language of nails AND the business language of revenue and retention.
- **Practical and results-focused** — "What does this save me? What does this make me?"
- Respects peer authority: *"Another salon owner said..."* matters
- Responds to specifics: give her numbers, not adjectives
- Appreciates: efficiency, ROI clarity, and not being talked down to
- Irritated by: overly simplistic "easy button" pitches and anything that treats her like a one-person operation

**Words that convert for her:** *staff management*, *commission tracking*, *client retention*, *multi-location*, *reports*, *save time*, *grow revenue*, *payroll simplified*, *your whole team*

## Quotes (Research-Synthesized)

> *"Managing staff is extremely difficult and they always end up fighting amongst each other... Some just decide to randomly resign with no notice, and even steal clients for home service."* — r/smallbusiness

> *"I've owned a salon for 2 years now and it's been a crazy journey... Most clients are loyal to their favorite staff, not necessarily the salon."* — r/smallbusiness

> *"Your time will be 50/50 between managing the business vs. working on clients."* — r/smallbusiness (on opening a nail salon)

> *"I switched to Vagaro and I'm liking it so far. If you have employees, I'd steer away from Gloss. Their reports suck."* — r/Esthetics

> *"After 8 months of paying for this and only using it 4 times I contacted them at 9am to cancel the account. This led to a 4-page conversation that lasted that employee's entire 8-hour shift — while I was at work running my 1-team salon."* — GlossGenius App Store review (salon owner frustrated with customer service)
