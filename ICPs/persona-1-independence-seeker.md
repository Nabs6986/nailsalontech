# Persona 1: The Independence Seeker
**"I'm finally doing this on my own — I just need to figure out the business side."**

---

## Overview

The Independence Seeker is a nail tech who has been working as an employee or commission worker at a salon for 2–5 years. They've built a loyal following, are tired of giving up 40–60% to the salon, and are ready to take the leap. They're confident in their nail skills but intimidated by the business side — taxes, bookings, payment, and marketing. This is their first time running a business.

## Day in the Life

**6:30am** — Checks Instagram DMs; 3 new clients want to book. Responds to each individually. Adds them to a Notes app manually.

**9:00am** — First client arrives at home studio. Does gel full set. Client asks about booking next appointment — she texts her the link to... her Instagram.

**12:00pm** — Lunch. Worries about a client who hasn't confirmed tomorrow. Sends a manual reminder text.

**2:00pm** — Client no-shows. Loses $85 and 2 hours. Posts a frustrated Story: "No show again. Deposit policy coming soon."

**4:00pm** — Finishes last client. Updates paper/Notes app schedule. Realizes she double-booked Saturday. Stresses.

**8:00pm** — Scrolls TikTok. Sees a nail tech video: "Why I switched to GlossGenius." Saves it. Goes down a rabbit hole comparing apps.

**10:00pm** — Still awake thinking: *"I need to actually set up a real booking system. But is it worth $30/month?"*

## Pain Points (Ranked)

**#1 — No-Shows & Last-Minute Cancellations**
> *"I lost $300 last week to no-shows. I do everything for free and I'm done."*
- No deposit system → lost income
- Manual reminder texts = her responsibility
- Feels awkward charging clients she knows personally
- Needs: deposit collection, automated reminders, cancellation policy enforcement

**#2 — Booking Chaos (DMs, texts, Notes app)**
> *"I'm spending 2 hours a day just managing my own schedule. I didn't go independent to be my own secretary."*
- Managing bookings via Instagram DMs and iMessage is unscalable
- Double-bookings happen regularly
- No 24/7 self-booking option for clients
- Needs: Online booking page clients can use anytime

**#3 — Looking Professional / Legitimate**
> *"My clients ask if I have a website. I send them a Linktree and feel embarrassed."*
- Working from home or a booth — wants to appear established
- No booking page = feels unprofessional
- Needs: branded booking site, professional confirmation emails, intake forms

**#4 — Payment Processing & Fees**
> *"Venmo works... but then Venmo freezes my account when I process too much. And I can't require deposits."*
- Uses Venmo/Zelle/cash → can't enforce deposits or refund/hold policies
- Doesn't understand processing fee differences (2.6% vs 2.75% etc.)
- Scared of paying monthly + transaction fees
- Needs: simple card-on-file, deposit collection, low flat fees

**#5 — Marketing & Finding New Clients**
> *"I went from having walk-ins at the salon to starting from zero. It's terrifying."*
- No salon foot traffic; must generate her own clients
- Instagram/TikTok are primary channels but consistency is hard
- Word of mouth is slow when starting
- Needs: booking link to share, client rebooking reminders, reviews tool

---

## Decision Factors (Ranked)

1. **Price / ROI** — Will this pay for itself? (Biggest blocker; "Is $30/month worth it?")
2. **Ease of Setup** — Can she do it herself in an afternoon without tech help?
3. **Client Experience** — Will her clients actually use it and like it?
4. **Deposit / No-Show Protection** — Can she finally enforce policies?
5. **Booking Page** — Does it look professional and branded?
6. **Payment Processing** — Low fees, fast payouts, card on file
7. **Automated Reminders** — Less manual texting

## Information Sources

| Channel | How She Uses It |
|---------|----------------|
| **TikTok** | Primary discovery — watches "nail tech business" videos; influenced by peers |
| **Instagram** | Saves posts from nail tech influencers; DMs peers to ask what they use |
| **Reddit (r/Nailtechs)** | Searches "best booking app nail tech" before deciding |
| **YouTube** | Watches setup tutorials once she's picked something |
| **Peer Recommendations** | Most trusted: "What does my friend use?" |
| **Google** | Comparison searches: "GlossGenius vs Square for nail tech" |
| **Facebook Groups** | Nail tech business groups (secondary) |

---

## Objections

| Objection | Reality / Reframe |
|-----------|------------------|
| *"I can just use Instagram DMs — it's free"* | She's spending 2+ hrs/day managing DMs; one no-show costs more than a month of software |
| *"$24–$30/month is too expensive when I'm just starting out"* | One prevented no-show = $80+ recouped; ROI is clear |
| *"My clients won't use an app / booking system"* | Most clients prefer self-booking — it's on-demand, no waiting for replies |
| *"I'm not tech-savvy enough to set it up"* | GlossGenius/Square can be live in under an hour with templates |
| *"I don't know which one to pick and I'm scared of picking wrong"* | Reviews/comparisons from peers and sites like NailSalonTech matter here |
| *"I'll set it up later when I have more clients"* | No-shows and chaos will prevent her from ever getting there |

## Language & Tone

She talks like a peer, not a business professional. Use:
- **Casual, warm, encouraging** — "girl, same" energy
- First-person peer voice: "When I was starting out..." or "Here's what actually works"
- Relatable frustration: "No-shows are NOT it"
- TikTok/Instagram language: "bestie," "sis," "okay but listen," "real talk"
- Avoid corporate-speak: "enterprise booking solution," "CRM workflows," "scalable infrastructure"
- She resonates with: **freedom, glow-up, protecting your time, boss moves**

**Words that convert for her:** *finally*, *easy*, *protect your income*, *look professional*, *clients love it*, *I switched and never looked back*
