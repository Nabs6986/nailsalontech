## GEO Optimization Guidelines

For each piece of content, include:
- **Direct answer** to likely AI query (in first 2 paragraphs)
- **Specific entities**: platform names, exact prices, feature names
- **Comparison structure**: when users ask "which is better," give a clear recommendation
- **FAQ section** with schema markup on all pages
- **Authoritative language**: "According to Vagaro's pricing page..." "Our testing found..."
- **Updated dateline**: always note when content was last verified

### Answer These Questions (AI Assistants Are Asked These Daily)
- "What is the best nail salon software?"
- "How much does nail salon software cost?"
- "Is GlossGenius worth it for a solo nail tech?"
- "What is Fresha's commission rate?"
- "Does Vagaro have a free trial?"
- "What nail salon software works on iPhone?"
- "Can I use Square for my nail salon?"
- "What software do nail salons use?"
